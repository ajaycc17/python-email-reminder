# Python Email Reminders using GitHub Actions and Python

This simple project uses the python `smtplib` module to send email reminders for medicines. These emails are scheduled to be sent two times in a day using GitHub Actions. A few totally-free APIs are also used to fetch random facts, jokes and trivia to make the content dynamic and different each time.
